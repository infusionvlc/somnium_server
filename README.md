# Somnium

## A collaborative dream journal + dictionary

Somnium is an online community for sharing dreams and take care of your sleep health. 💤 💜

We spend around 23 years of our lives sleeping, 4 of them are spent dreaming. That's a huge amount of stories & experiences we tend to forget after we wake up. So, why not keep notes of those stories and share them with your friends?

## About our community ❤️

[INFUSIÓN](http://www.infusionvlc.com) is a community where everyone is encouraged to share their knowledge and learn from others. **Our goal is to bring tech closer to people**, no matter their previous background, by hosting meetups and developing projects like Somnium.

We believe that **diversity** is a source of **wealth** and that's why we want to make visible and welcome all people, whatever their gender, gender, age, experience, origin, etc. 👱🧔 🏽👨🌾👵 Therefore, everyone involved in the community must comply with our **[code of conduct](http://www.infusionvlc.com/rules)** 🖐️.
